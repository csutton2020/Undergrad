    //(8 pts) This is the constructor that takes as input x, which is the size of the list you’ll be creating. The constructor then generates x random numbers between 0 and 100, and uses the DLL’s methods to insert each random number into the list in order. It then prints out the list both forwards and backwards. Your main should call this constructor with a random number between 10 and 20, and that will pretty much test most of the methods. For testing purposes, you can print out the list forwards and backwards after inserting each new number to make sure everything is working.
